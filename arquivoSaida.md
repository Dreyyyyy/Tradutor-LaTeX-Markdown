###### How to create Sections and Subsections

Simply use the section and **subsection commands** as in this example document! With Overleaf, all the formatting and numbering is handled automatically according to the template you've chosen. If you're using Rich Text mode, you can also create new *section and subsections* via the buttons in the editor toolbar.
